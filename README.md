  ## Description
     I created this application to better understand Node.js. This application helped me utilize my knowledge of JavaScript to create a command line application. This project also helped me understand node package manager and allowed me to become familiar with Inquirer. It allows the user to create a README file from prompts that are asked from the command line.
